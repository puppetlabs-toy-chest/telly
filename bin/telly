# This script adds test results in testrail from a finished beaker run
# It takes in a beaker junit file and a TestRail Testrun ID
# 
# It matches the beaker tests with TestRail testcases by looking for the 
#   test case ID in the beaker script. The combination of a test run and a test case
#   allows the script to add a result for a particular instance of a test case.
#   In TestRail parlance, this is confusingly called a test.
# From the TestRail API docs:
#   "In TestRail, tests are part of a test run and the test cases are part of the
#   related test suite. So, when you create a new test run, TestRail creates a test
#   for each test case found in the test suite of the run. You can therefore think
#   of a test as an “instance” of a test case which can have test results, comments 
#   and a test status.""
